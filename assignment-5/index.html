        <h1> Kobe Bean Bryant</h1>
        <h2> Why he is the goat</h2>

            He famously pushed his way to the Los Angeles Lakers in the draft 
            and joined a team on the rise built around Shaquille O'Neal. 
            Suddenly, one of the buzziest young players in years was in one of the country's biggest media markets. 
            Bryant played second fiddle to O'Neal early in his career, 
            but he was able to develop into a star in his own right under a bright spotlight. 
            Though O'Neal was the anchor to those Lakers teams that won three straight championships, Bryant was the more aesthetically pleasing player to watch. 
            Lanky and hyper-athletic, Bryant was the Lakers' perimeter threat, a player liable to drive the lane and dunk or hit a pull-up jump shot at any moment. 
            He became the most exciting player to watch on a team that became the face of the NBA following Michael Jordan's retirement.

            In total, he won five titles, one shy of Jordan's six. He was an 18-time All-Star, making it 17 consecutive years. He was a 15-time All-NBA First Team member and a 12-time member of the All-Defensive team. He holds several NBA records today and is permanently etched into the league's history. Just as importantly, he did it all with one team.
