        <h1>Lyrics</h1>
        <p>Damn<br />
        I mean<br />
        I just keep thinking about you (Oh baby)<br />
        It's like you got some kind of hold on me<br/>
        And I don't know(Oh oh oh)<br/>
        But i'm a go ahead and talk about it<br/>
        </p>
        <p>I'm sitting looking out the window like damn<br />
            Tryna fix this situation that's at hand<br />
            You still running through my mind when I'm knowing that you shouldn't be<br />
            Me all on yo mind and I'm knowing that it couldn't be
        </p>
        <p>Cause you ain't call and I ain't even appalled<br />
            I still got a lot of pain I ain't dealt wit it all<br />
            I been running 'round with other chicks<br />
            I'm single and they lovin' it<br />
            I'm liking it but I just want the one that was in love with<br />
            That's not the end of it, I'm tryna let you go<br />
            I can't get a grip of it is what I'm tryna let you know<br />
            You got a hold or some kind of control of me<br />
            I don't know what it is, but I gotta get you gone from me<br />
            I'm working at it and it ain't getting no better just<br />
            Tryna be like yeah, forget it, whatever<br />
            Instead of staring out this glass looking at this bad weather<br />
            Damn, I gotta pull myself together 'cause<br />
        </p>
        <p>When I'm with somebody all I think 'bout is you (yeah)<br />
            When I'm all alone that's all I wanna do (yeah)<br />
            I miss the smiling faces in my sidekick<br />
            Outta town visits,<br />
            All the time we spent together makes it hard to get you outta my system<br />
            You know what you do to me (do to me)<br />
            You don't even understand (damn)<br />
            You know what you do to me (do to me)<br />
            It's so hard to get you outta my system (oh oh oh)<br />
        </p>
        <p>I'm too attached, my heart won't let me fall back<br />
            I got it bad, that's what you could call that (ah)<br />
            And when I see you in the streets, that's the worse for me<br />
            Used to love the little things you did, that's what works for me<br />
            It's too major, don't see you on my pager<br />
            Know what you doing, where you at<br />
            Can I see you later? (can I see you lata?)<br />
            The fellas telling me 'just let her go Bow'<br />
            Believe me, I'm tryin' man, I just don't know how<br />
            I be in all the top spots, leaving with the hot shots<br />
            Knowing they just want me cause I'm in the top spot<br />
            That's not poppin' and my brain ain't stoppin'<br />
            Thinkin' who she with, or where she goin', is she club hoppin'?<br />
            I never had this kind of problem in my life<br />
            This is my first time dealing with this kind of fight<br />
            It's every night and every flight and every time you in my sight<br />
            Damn this ain't even right, 'cause<br />
        </p>
        <p>When I'm with somebody all I think 'bout is you (yeah)<br />
            When I'm all alone that's all I wanna do (yeah)<br />
            I miss the smiling faces in my sidekick<br />
            Outta town visits, all the time we spent together makes it hard to get you outta my system<br />
            You know what you do to me (do to me)<br />
            You don't even understand (damn)<br />
            You know what you do to me (do to me)<br />
            It's so hard to get you out of my system (oh ohh ohhhh)<br />
        </p>
        <p>Is it wrong for me to feel this way, you been running through my mind all day<br />
            (can you feel me?)<br />
            I been tryna get you off my mind, but I can't after all this time<br />
            (that's what kills me)<br />
            Is it wrong for me to feel this way, you been running through my mind all day<br />

            It's so hard to get you outta my system (oh oh oh)<br />
        </p>
        <p>I remember everything that me 'n you talked about<br />
            Me 'n you had a whole life planned out together (oh ohh ohh)<br />
            And if I could, I would,<br />
            Turn back the hands of time<br />
            And correct all my mistakes that I ever did<br />
            But now I guess I gotta move on, right?<br />
            It's still hard<br />
            And I still love you till this day<br />
            <br />
            Peace
